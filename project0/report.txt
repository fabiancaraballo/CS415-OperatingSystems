I ran my project and it runs pretty good except for one thing. Whenever angram.c is ran I get a warning which I am able to ignore and still get the proper output. The warning I am get when anagram.c is ran is

"anagram.c: In function ‘AddWordAList’:
anagram.c:284:29: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘AppendSList’ from incompatible pointer type
                 AppendSList(newNode->Words, newString);
                             ^
anagram.c:54:6: note: expected ‘struct StringList **’ but argument is of type ‘struct StringList *’
 void AppendSList(struct StringList **head, struct StringList *node) {
      ^
"


However I am able to ignore this and still run. When I run the commands:
./anagram <anytestFILE>.dict

	OR

./anagram <anytestFILE>.dict > <name>.out
diff <name>.out <GIVENtestOUTPUTS>.out

It works just fine which is nice.

When I run valgrind I get no signs of memory leaks which is great. (At least I think so, I am not the best with valgrind but my output looks very similar to the valgrind post from piazza where Roscoe said "The output looks great"
so I am going to assume that this is the same case with my program!)
