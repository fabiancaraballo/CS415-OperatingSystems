I am going to be honest, this is the sorriest excuse for project1. I started this project late and realized I have absolutely no idea what is goin on. I know this isn't ideal and I did awful but I plan on meeting with Professor Malony to discuss my grade and I am going to turn a leaf for the rest of the class. There is 50% left to submit so I hope I am able to pass. I am sorry to waste your time but I am hoping I don't receive a 0% and can at least get the 10% from this report. Any bit would help.
Thank you,
  Fabian Caraballo
